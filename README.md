# ShineWithGlory Cleaning Services

**ShineWithGlory** is a modern, responsive website built for a local cleaning business. It allows potential clients to learn about the services offered, send appointment requests via an email form, and contact the business directly on WhatsApp. A location map is also embedded to help customers find the service area easily.

This project was built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and integrates **EmailJS** for handling contact form submissions without a custom backend.
